# Pixel_brush
- A block-based sketching pad where you sketch with randomly generated colors on each stroke
- The sketch pad is built on a 16x16 grid by defaukt you can readjust its size on the settings.

> [!NOTE]
> The application is built on the focus on improving my understanding on DOM manipulation and Flexbox from CSS

This is the [live preview](...)

## Challanges

- I have to figure out how to create pop up models using javascript
- How to make each block take the space available on the pad no matter how many they are (2 - 16 square)

## Development
